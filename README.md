# Welcome to Sofira - the per{SO}nal {FI}nance t{RA}cker

Hello! I am so greatful, that you found my first little python project!  
First of all: yes, the title is a wip... if you have a better one, hmu.  

This whole project started because I wanted to get away from Notion to plan my finances and wanted a little project between college classes.
All Data is stored in *plain text*, so if you like you can just chuck your .txt in any other Note-taking app which uses text.
And - I can't stress, how important that is - pls ignore my ugly code haha.

## How to install

#### Requirements
- [TKinter:](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-install-tkinter-in-python)
- [Pillow:](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/basic-installation.html)

#### To install
After both packages are installed correctly to your python, simply download Sofira and execute (double-click) sofira.py in the Main folder.

## How to use

#### First use
After downloading and opening Sofira, you should see a -3 at total, a -0.10 at daily and a -0.70 at weekly. 
Those are your allowances; total being the whole month and so on.

1.  Go to settings in the upper-right corner and set the monthly income you want Sofira to use.
2.  Then, set all the Categories of expenses you think you'll do.
3.  After that, go to 'set monthly expenses', delete the two entries by selecting them, and pressing 'del'
4.  Then add your own by typing their names on the left, their amounts on the right and pressing add. Once you're done, you can close the window.
6.  Finally, press 'create new file', name it, accept name, and press save. After that restart and reload.

#### General use
- To add an expense, simply press the plus-button, fill in the new window and press 'subtract'.
- To see old expenses, press the list icon.
- To open a .txt file, press open.
- Each day, the 'Daily label will be reset, the same applies to weekly and total. An expense will be subtracted from all three Allowances. There is currently no good way to delete an old expense. Sorry.
